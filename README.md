# CEPlusEICAR

This repository was created to assist assessors with accessing the AMTSO and Browser Test files from the Cyber Essentials Plus scheme. 

All files are taken from the EICAR Project and are used to test anti-malware protection for a variety of products. 

These files may be flagged by antivirus programs, but they do not contain any malicious code and cannot cause damage to your systems.
